Implementation phase 1

**have as much of this done as possible by 9 April **

- We have several files for the Java:
     - tillView.java : lays out the GUI, buttons, has methods that draw or hide elements.
     - tillController.java : listens for actions from tillView.java, and invokes various methods in tillView.java and tillModel.java
     - tillModel.java : this file deals with the database; reading, updating, etc...

 MySql Database:
  Holds tables and data
  
 Here are the people with their main tasks:
